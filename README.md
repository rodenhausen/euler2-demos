A demo has the following structure:

* `./commands` the commands executed in the demo, organized in yaml format
* `./{anything else}` any output produced by the demo

commands example:

```
version:
 euler2 --version
help:
 euler2 --help
```
 
run examples:

* `./run all`: executes all commands of the demo in consecutive order
* `./run help`: executes the command labeled help
* `./run version,help,...`: executes the commands given in the listed order
* `./run version-help`: executes the commands in consecutive order from label version to help
* `./run clean`: resets the demo to a state before any run execution
